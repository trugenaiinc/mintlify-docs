| Model         | Description                                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Huma-1**    | Expressive Avatar Model - lifelike emotion, micro-expressions, speech sync |
| **Hawkeye-1** | Vision-powered action recognition for real-time interactions               |

## Effortless API Integration Anywhere

Launch branded AI agents in minutes. Our white-label APIs give you complete control of:
- Personality and tone
- Knowledge sources
- Visual avatars
- Voice and language
- UI experience

## Lightning Fast Performance

Our models respond in **under one second**, establishing a new benchmark for real-time human-like interactions.

| Capability                     | Metric         |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- |
| End-to-End Agent Latency       | **≤ 1 second** |
| Speech-to-Avatar Response Time | **≤ 80 ms**    |
| Uptime                         | **> 99.9%**    |
| Concurrent Sessions            | **Unlimited**  |

Trugen delivers **10x faster response times** compared to traditional pipelines - proven at global scale.

## Knowledge-Based Real-Time Intelligence

Connect your agents to internal docs, support articles, product data, or APIs.
Responses are **context-aware**, **brand-true**, and **factual** - not generic guesses.

Agents adapt dynamically based on:

* Knowledge Bases
* Real-time user actions
* Tool / API calls
