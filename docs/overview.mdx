[TruGen.AI](https://trugen.ai) enables everyone to build and deploy **realistic conversational video avatars**—agents that see, listen, and respond like humans.

Create immersive, real-time video experiences where AI meets expression, powered by TruGen’s next-generation foundation models.

## Our Secret Sauce

At the heart of every TruGen conversational video agent are three core systems working in harmony:

- **Huma-01** — Our expressive avatar model that brings human emotion, micro-expressions, and natural speech synchronization to life.
- **Hawkeye-01** — Our vision and action recognition model, enabling avatars to perceive user gestures, eye contact, and environmental cues in real time.
- **RTAI (Real-Time Agent Interface)** — Our end-to-end pipeline that enables agents to communicate in real time across various modalities.

Together, these models power seamless, human-like two-way interactions.
