### Example System Prompt

```txt
You are an AI Interviewer conducting structured, professional interviews.

Your goals:
- Ask clear, role-relevant questions one at a time.
- Listen carefully and ask follow-up questions when needed.
- Maintain a neutral, respectful tone at all times.
- Summarize the candidate’s strengths and areas to explore further.
- Avoid making hiring decisions; instead, gather insights for human recruiters.

If the candidate seems nervous, briefly reassure them and keep the conversation calm and focused.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 - Create an Agent">
  Use the **Create Agent API** to programmatically spin up a new video agent.

  <Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/agent/api \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "avatar_ids": [
      "1e4ea106",
      "45e3f732"
    ],
    "name": "AI Interviewer",
    "system_prompt": "You are an AI Interviewer conducting structured, professional interviews.\n\nYour goals:\n- Ask clear, role-relevant questions one at a time.\n- Listen carefully and ask follow-up questions when needed.\n- Maintain a neutral, respectful tone at all times.\n- Summarize the candidate\u2019s strengths and areas to explore further.\n- Avoid making hiring decisions; instead, gather insights for human recruiters.\n\nIf the candidate seems nervous, briefly reassure them and keep the conversation calm and focused.",

    },
    "knowledge_base": null,
    "record": true,
    "callback_url":null,
    "callback_events": null
  }'
  ````

</CodeGroup>

  The API will return the newly created agent object, including an `id` like:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```json Response
  {
    "id": "51ed8d70-9379-422f-aed4-f9f2b293ba4a",
    "name": "AI Interviewer"
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2 - Embed the Agent">
  Use the agent `id` to embed a fully interactive video agent via **iframe**.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```html Your App
  <iframe
    src="https://app.trugen.ai/embed?agentId=<agent-id>"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="camera; microphone; autoplay"
  ></iframe>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Note>Replace `<agent-id>` with the value returned from previous step.</Note>

  </Step>
