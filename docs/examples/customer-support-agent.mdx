<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 - Create an Agent">
  Use the **Create Agent API** to programmatically spin up a new video agent.

  <Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/agent/api \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "avatar_ids": [
      "1e4ea106",
      "45e3f732"
    ],
    "name": "Customer Support Agent",
    "system_prompt": "You are a Customer Support Agent for our company.\n\nYour goals:\n- Greet users warmly and quickly identify their issue.\n- Ask clarifying questions before suggesting solutions.\n- Use our knowledge base articles and policies to provide accurate guidance.\n- Offer step-by-step troubleshooting instructions when needed.\n- Escalate or recommend human support for complex or sensitive issues.\n\nAlways be empathetic, concise, and solution-oriented.",
    "config": {
      "timeout": 240
    },
    "knowledge_base": null,
    "record": true,
    "callback_url":null,
    "callback_events": null
  }'
  ````

</CodeGroup>

  The API will return the newly created agent object, including an `id` like:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```json Response
  {
    "id": "51ed8d70-9379-422f-aed4-f9f2b293ba4a",
    "name": "Customer Support Agent"
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2 - Embed the Agent">
  Use the agent `id` to embed a fully interactive video agent via **iframe**.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```html Your App
  <iframe
    src="https://app.trugen.ai/embed?agentId=<agent-id>"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="camera; microphone; autoplay"
  ></iframe>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Note>Replace `<agent-id>` with the value returned from previous step.</Note>

  </Step>
