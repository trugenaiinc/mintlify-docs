<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 - Create an Agent">
  Use the **Create Agent API** to programmatically spin up a new video agent.

  <Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/agent/api \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "avatar_ids": [
      "ava_ae61c9e28b",
      "ava_ed3a666dc5"
    ],
    "name": "New Agent",
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "config": {
      "timeout": 240
    },
    "is_active": true,
    "knowledge_base": [
      {
        "id": "4a0365e4-ced5-42f0-8933-b6880a0ce044",
        "name": "new kb 123"
      }
    ],
    "record": true,
    "callback_url": "https://play.svix.com/in/e_pBuXcpDaVzRzwn3L5El4xFFlKnD/",
    "callback_events": [
      "participant_left",
      "max_call_duration_warning",
      "max_call_duration_timeout",
      "action_found"
    ]
  }'
  ````

</CodeGroup>

  The API will return the newly created agent object, including an `id` like:
  <CodeGroup>
  ```json Response
  {
    "id": "agt_12345example",
    "name": "New Agent"
  }
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2 - Embed the Agent">
  Use the agent `id` to embed a fully interactive video agent via **iframe**.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```html Your App
  <iframe
    src="https://app.trugen.ai/embed?agentId=<agent-id>"
    width="100%"
    height="600"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="camera; microphone; autoplay"
  ></iframe>
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Note>Replace `<agent-id>` with the value returned from previous step.</Note>

  </Step>
