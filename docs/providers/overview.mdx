The TruGen platform integrates with multiple **industry-leading AI providers** to power speech recognition (STT), language reasoning (LLM), and voice synthesis (TTS).
Using the Providers API, you can retrieve a list of all supported external providers and determine which options are available for your agents.

A **provider** is an external engine that powers one capability in the conversational pipeline. Each provider entry includes a `provider_type` property that identifies whether it supports **STT**, **LLM**, or **TTS**.

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Capability | Description |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Groq** | LLM | Ultra-low latency reasoning and response generation. |
| **OpenAI** | LLM | High-quality reasoning and multi-modal language intelligence. |
| **Deepgram** | STT | Streaming, low-latency speech-to-text transcription. |
| **ElevenLabs** | TTS | Realistic expressive voice synthesis in multiple languages & voices. |

<Note>We are adding more providers and model configurations constantly.</Note>

---

## Use Cases

- Determine which LLM or voice engine is active for a deployed agent
- Allow users to choose preferred voice or reasoning engines dynamically
- Build UI selection menus inside dashboards
- Validate that a region supports a specific vendor or capability

## Retrieve All Providers

Use this endpoint to fetch the list of currently available providers:

### **GET** `/v1/providers`

### Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash List Providers
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/providers \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>'
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key from the **Developer Portal**.</Note>

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `llm` | Large Language Model provider used for reasoning & response generation |
| `stt` | Speech-to-Text provider used for realtime transcription                |
