Customize your conversation experience by selecting specific speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) settings. Our platform is powered by **Deepgram** for high-accuracy transcription and **ElevenLabs** for life-like vocal synthesis.

### Supported Languages

We support a wide range of global languages. Spoken interactions are processed through a dual-engine pipeline:

1. **Deepgram (STT):** Transcribes your participant's audio into text.
2. **ElevenLabs (TTS):** Converts the agent's response into natural-sounding speech.

Below is a sample list of the primary languages supported across our standard models:

| Language | STT Code (Deepgram) | TTS Support (ElevenLabs) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **English** | `en` | Yes |
| **Spanish** | `es` | Yes |
| **French** | `fr` | Yes |
| **German** | `de` | Yes |
| **Hindi** | `hi` | Yes |
| **Portuguese** | `pt` | Yes |
| **Chinese** | `zh` | Yes |
| **Japanese** | `ja` | Yes |
| **Korean** | `ko` | Yes |

### Setting the Conversation Language for your agent

While creating an agent you have the ability to set the STT provider and select the desired language.
<CodeGroup>
```bash Create new Agent
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/ext/agent \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --data @- <<EOF
{
  "agent_name": "AI Agent",
  "config": { "timeout": 240 },
  "avatars": [
    {
      "config": {
        "llm": {
          "provider": "openai",
          "model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
        },
        "stt": { "provider": "deepgram", "model": "nova-3", language: "multi" },
        "tts": { "provider": "elevenlabs", "voice_id": "ZUrEGyu8GFMwnHbvLhv2" }
      },
      "persona_name": "Sample AI Agent",
      "persona_prompt": "You're a helpful AI agent."
    }
  ]
}

```
