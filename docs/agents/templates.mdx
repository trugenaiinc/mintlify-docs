Templates define the **persona, behavior, and conversational structure** of your AI agents.
Rather than configuring every setting manually for each agent, templates allow you to **standardize personality, tone, rules, knowledge source bindings, and interaction style**-making it easy to deploy consistent agent experiences at scale.

Templates act as reusable blueprints that multiple agents can inherit and override, enabling fast iteration, A/B testing, version control, and brand governance.

---

## What Can a Template Include?

A template may consist of the following configurable components:

- **System Prompt** - Defines the agent’s role, tone, and knowledge scope. This is the core directive that shapes reasoning and personality.
- **Entry Message** - A greeting or onboarding message that triggers when the session begins.
- **Exit Message** - A closing or farewell message when the conversation ends or disconnects.
- **Idle Timeout** - Specifies how the agent responds when user silence or inactivity occurs.
- **Knowledge Base Attachments** - Bind knowledge sources such as documents, products, FAQs, or APIs.
- **Behavior & Safety Settings** - Control boundaries, compliance rules, escalation, and maximum session length.
- **Callback Events & Webhooks** - Trigger external workflows or UI updates.

> Templates ensure that every agent deployed by your organization shares consistent brand voice, intelligence grounding, and conversation workflow - whether you have 1 agent or thousands.

## Getting Started

Documents and web pages are indexed and made available to agents through the **Knowledge Base** component.
Once your Knowledge Base is created, upload documents and tag them to your template so all agents derived from it automatically inherit that intelligence.

<Note>Template creation and management can be performed using the API or visually through our Developer Platform.</Note>

## Create & Use a Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 - Create a New Template">

Create a conversational template using the API. This example shows a minimal configuration.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Create New Template
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/template \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '
{
  "template_name": "Sales Assistant Template",
  "template_system_prompt": "You are a friendly AI sales assistant that guides users through product selection and answers detailed product questions clearly.",
  "config": {
    "systemPrompt": "Respond in a conversational tone and always ask follow-up questions.",
    "conversationalContext": "sales",
    "maxCallDuration": 300
  },
  "knowledge_base": [
    {
      "id": "15b12908-309f-4e0f-bcb0-a4e23d45169a",
      "name": "Product Catalog"
    }
  ],
  "is_active": true,
  "record": true,
  "callback_url": "",
  "callback_events": []
}'
````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Developer Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```json Sample Template Creation Response
{
  "id": "d65a4f92-44b1-4fe6-b2ac-a1cb66366ddc",
  "message": "Template created successfully"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2 - Create an Agent Using This Template">

Now use the created template to spin up a fully configured agent automatically.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Create New Agent with Template
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/agent/bytemplate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
  --data '
{
  "avatar_ids": [
    "ava_ed3a666dc5",
    "ava_ae61c9e28b"
  ],
  "template_id": "76d9ff1d-b1d5-4dee-9b9a-d4c4d58c9c55",
  "email": "demo@trugen.ai"
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>Replace `template_id` with the actual template `id` returned in Step 1.</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```json Sample Agent Creation Response
{
  "id": "51ed8d70-9379-422f-aed4-f9f2b293ba4a",
  "message": "Agent created successfully"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>
