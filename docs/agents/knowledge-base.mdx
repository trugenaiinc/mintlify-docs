title: Knowlege Base
---

Integrate your own documents, or knowledge to deliver grounded, brand-specific conversations.

Agents can dynamically reference multiple resources, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and contextual knowledge. With Knowledge Base integration, every answer is context-aware, brand-true, and rooted in your company’s knowledge-not generic guesses.

We support two modes or interaction with Knowledge Base's while the agent responds,
  1. Traditional `rag` mode; where each user query is searched against the knowledge base.
  2. `agentic` mode; here the LLM takes a decision to search each knowledge base depending on the user query.

# Getting Started

Documents and websites are indexed and made available to agents using the Knowledge Base component, simply create a knowledge base, upload your documents and tag it with the agents.

<Note>Knowledge Base creation and management can be performed using the API's or our Developer Platform.</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 — Create new Knowledge Base">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Create New Knowledge Base
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/knowledgebase \
      --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
      --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
      --form 'name=Sample Knowledge Base' \
      --form 'description=A simple test knowledge base' \
      --form is_active=true \
      --form input='@example-file' \
      --form 'text=Sample file text'
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    <Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>
    - Our API supports several different formats and knowledge sources to be indexed and created as knowledge base.
    Supported Documents format: `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt` and `.html`
    - You can also add raw text input as knowledge.
    - You can also add a website URL; that can be scrapped and indexed into the knowledge base.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```json Sample Knowledge Base Response
    {
      "id": "5273e435-3cbb-4a11-9ea9-2c150ba19009",
      "message": "Knowledge Base created successfully"
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2 — Create/Edit Agent to add Knowledge Base">
  Use the **Create/Update Agent API** to programmatically attach 1 or more Knowledge Base to your agent.

  <Note>Replace `<api-key>` with your actual API key generated from our [Portal](https://app.trugen.ai).</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.trugen.ai/v1/agent/api \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "avatar_ids": [
      "ava_ae61c9e28b",
      "ava_ed3a666dc5"
    ],
    "name": "New Agent",
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "config": {
      "timeout": 240
    },
    "is_active": true,
    "knowledge_base": [
      {
        "id": "5273e435-3cbb-4a11-9ea9-2c150ba19009",
        "name": "Sample Knowledge Base"
      }
    ],
    "record": true,
  }'
  ````
</CodeGroup>
 - You can attach more than 1 more knowledge base to the agent by simply adding them to the `knowledge_base` array in the request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3 — Start a conversation">
    Any conversation from this point on with this agent will leverage the Knowledge Base(s) attached.
  </Step>
</Steps>
