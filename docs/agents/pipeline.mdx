Trugen’s end-to-end conversational pipeline connects **speech, understanding, reasoning, and response generation** into one continuous flow:

1. **STT (Speech-to-Text)** — Converts user speech into text instantly.
2. **Turn Detection** — Determines when to listen, respond, or pause, ensuring natural timing.
3. **LLM (Language Model)** — Generates intelligent, contextually aware responses.
4. **Knowledge Base Integration** — Grounds responses in your brand tone and content.
5. **TTS (Text-to-Speech)** — Synthesizes expressive voice with matching facial motion through **Huma-01**.

This pipeline enables responses **under one second**, driving natural, real-time conversation.
