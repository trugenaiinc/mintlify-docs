The Trugen Agent Platform API lets you **programmatically create, configure, and manage conversational video agents**—including their personas, knowledge, tools, and visual avatars.

Use these APIs to:
- Spin up video agents tailored to your brand and workflows
- Define reusable persona templates for consistent behavior
- Connect agents to your own data and tools
- Retrieve available providers and avatar options
- Fully automate lifecycle management from your backend or CI/CD

---

## Core Components

The API is organized around a few core components:

- **Video Agents** — Create, fetch, update, and delete conversational video agents.
- **Persona Templates** — Define reusable system prompts, behaviors, and flows.
- **Knowledge Base** — Attach documents and data sources that ground agent responses.
- **Providers** — Inspect which LLM, TTS, and other providers are available.
- **Avatars** — Discover avatar configurations for visual rendering.
- **Tools (MCP & API Tools)** — Register tools and APIs that agents can call during conversations.
